# Assessment1

●	What did you like about this project?
  there's a difference between knowing something and being able to do something. I like this challenge cos it help me to understant up to what extend I can apply the knowladge I already have.


●	What did you struggle with in this project?
  Sometimes it difficult to undestand how css works. how elements occupy the space in dom? specially I I had trobble with on media quaries when I design nav-bar and footer. still dont understant why my element behave that way.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

  For two reasons I didn't follow the tempalte you provided.

  1) As this is my 2nd webpage, I wanted learn from begining despite risk of being of possibility to go everything wrong (I didnt have the full confidence though)

  2) As we have follow some strict dimensions, I thought I may be easier start from the begging (since I dont have much experiance, I thought may be difficut to debug if positioning goes wrong) so that I can get the full control.
